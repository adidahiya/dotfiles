My personal dotfiles, including nvm set up for fish shell, Vundle for vim, and some vim color themes.

All files should be placed in `~/`.

### macOS setup

```sh
mkdir ~/Developer
cd ~/Developer/temp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adidahiya/dotfiles/master/.osx
sudo bash .osx
```

### Vim setup

For YouCompleteMe completion engine support, follow its
[installation instructions](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/tree/master).
